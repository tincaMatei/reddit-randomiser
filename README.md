# reddit-randomiser

This is a small server written in Rust that retrieves random reddit posts from a subreddit.

# Usage

Go to the server's address and add `"/r/<subreddit>/"` to browse random posts from that subreddit. To get another post, you should refresh the page.

# Installation

You should install `Cargo` to run the program.

Clone the repository and `cd` inside it.

Do `cargo run`.

The default port is `6969` (nice), you can change it in the source code.
